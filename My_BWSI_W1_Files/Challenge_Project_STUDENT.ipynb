It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby or cretinism.\n","\n","Worldwide, too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. In countries with enough iodine in the diet, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.\n","\n","Worldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In the United States, hypothyroidism occurs in 0.3–0.4% of people.\n","\n","And that is why we iodize salt.\n","\n","![alt text](https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2013/11/15/17/39/ds00181_-ds00344_-ds00353_-ds00491_-ds00492_-ds00567_-ds00660_-my00709_im01872_thyroid_gif.jpg)\n","\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"OFF1-BLiSLZ8","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Background: Doctors all around the world need our help to predict whether a patient has hypothyroid disease. We have already overspent our budget to collect such complete data on about 30 attributes for 2800 patients--a good starting number, but a larger sample would certainly be preferred. Moving forward, however, we simply cannot afford to spend so much money on data collection. Therefore, we also need to determine which attributes are the most meaningful to the predictive models, and cut out the rest that don't contribute much. \n","\n","The boss wants to see a **balanced** model that can predict with a **high sensitivity** and **high specificity** while using a ***low amount of features***. Collecting complete data such as this is very rare, very time-consuming, and often very expensive. By minimizing the number of features, it will optimize future data collection by deciding what needs to be collected, and what doesn't."]},{"metadata":{"id":"HsZB_SGvp4mP","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Loading the

The points are weighted, and are designed to equate to 0 in a Zero Rule baseline model.

In doing so, we hope you see the importance of clinical considerations and treat your models from a more human perspective, rather than detached from it.\n","\n","**Real World Cost**: Similar to the confusion matrix, we want you to keep in mind the other aspects of healthcare analytics--in this case, economic feasibility.
